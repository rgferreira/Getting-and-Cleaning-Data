# Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data
This repo is intended for submitting the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data (coursera-JHU).
The course is so fun and I wish I finish the Data Science specialization this year 2015.

Raw data
--------
We are accessing several raw data sources, as follows:
- **features.txt** is the complete list of variables contained in the data files.
- **activity_labels.txt** contains the six indexed types of activities.
- **X_train.txt** and **X_test.txt** contain, respectively, the features data for the training and test subjects.
- **Y_train.txt** and **Y_test.txt** conatin, respectively, the activity labels for the training and test subjects.

Script
------
For the script to run, the following data zip must be extracted in the same directory as the script is.
The data is available here:

The so called *run_analysis.R* script tries to answer the five questions for the course project:
- 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The comments inside the code refer to these as "Steps" with formatted tags as "<"Step i">"
