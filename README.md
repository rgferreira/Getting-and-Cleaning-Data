# Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data
This repo is intended for submitting the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data (coursera-JHU).
The course is so fun and I wish I finish the Data Science specialization this year 2015.

Raw data
--------
We are accessing several raw data sources, as follows:
- **features.txt** is the complete list of variables contained in the data files.
- **activity_labels.txt** contains the six indexed types of activities.
- **X_train.txt** and **X_test.txt** contain, respectively, the features data for the training and test subjects.
- **Y_train.txt
